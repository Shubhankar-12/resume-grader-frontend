        "Dear Hiring Manager,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in the Full Stack Developer position at your esteemed company. With a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team. My experience as a MERN Developer Intern at Com.Bot, where I engineered backend APIs using Node.js and integrated over 500 third-party applications, has equipped me with the skills necessary to build scalable systems efficiently. \n\nCurrently, I am a Junior Developer at Stylabs Technologies, where I have architected high-performance landing pages using Nuxt.js and PayloadCMS, achieving an impressive Lighthouse score of over 85. My role involves designing and deploying REST APIs with Node.js, Typescript, and MongoDB, which aligns perfectly with your requirement for a developer who can own the entire tech stack.\n\nI thrive in high-pressure environments and have a deep obsession with code quality and system design. My projects, such as the Crown Clothing App and Filmpire, showcase my ability to develop full-stack applications using React, Redux, and various other technologies. I am particularly drawn to the challenge of working with bleeding-edge technologies like GraphQL and Docker, and I am eager to bring my hacker mentality to your team.\n\nI am confident that my skills in TypeScript, microservices, and my passion for solving complex problems make me a strong candidate for this role. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team and help drive your projects to success.\n\nThank you for considering my application.\n\nSincerely,\nShubh Shubhankar\nshubhankar719@gmail.com\n+91-8709641223",
